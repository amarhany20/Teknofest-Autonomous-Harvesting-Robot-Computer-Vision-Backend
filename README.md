# Autonomous Harfesting Robot Computer Vision Backend for TEKNOFEST 2023

This Backend is made using FLASK library and python. It is about a computer vision that detects fruits and gets their coodrinators and send it to the robot drone for collecting it. it is linked to a front end for selecting which fruit. It detects the fruits and the fruit colors. The Project uses PYTORCH library so, it can be gpu accelareted using NVIDIA CUDA and NVIDIA CUDNN. it can detect up to 30FPS using RTX 2060
## Installation

You have to import ultralytics first

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

for gpu acceleration, remove all pytorch libraries and then download it from their website
